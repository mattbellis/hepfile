    '''
    This wraps on `hepfile.awkward_tools.awkward_to_hepfile` to write a list of dictionaries to a hepfile.
    
    Writes a list of dictlike object to a hepfile. Must have a specific format:
    - each dictlike object is a "event"
    - first level of dict keys are the groups
    - second level of dict keys are the datasets
    - entries in second level of dict object is the data and can be either awkward arrays or lists
    - data entries in the first level of the dict are singleton objects

    Args:
        dict_list (list): list of dictionaries where each dictionary holds information on an event
        outfile (str): path to write output hepfile to
        **kwargs: passed to `hepfile.write.write_to_file`
    Returns:
        Dictionary of Awkward Arrays with the data stored in outfile
