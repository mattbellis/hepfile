Here we will go through the steps involved in analyzing data using
hepfile. There are many different tutorials to give as much information
as possible! To follow along with these tutorials you can download the
corresponding notebook using the github icon in the top right corner
of the tutorial. Or, if you'd prefer, you can use the `binder link <https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/mattbellis/hepfile/HEAD?urlpath=lab/tree/docs/example_nb>`
in the README of the github!
